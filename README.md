# Why Unicornteach?

## The Need

The pandemic situation has forced evryone confined in their rooms. Classes have changed online. Online has become the 'new normal' of various industries but mainly in the educational sector. The classes have shifted to various online platforms such as Google Meet , Zoom or Microsoft Teams.

### The Problem ?

<div align="center">

![High Data Consumption](https://github.com/hackerflow-io/UnicornDev-s/blob/main/Assets/highdata.png)

</div>

Theses platforms as a whole was not build and optimized for online education, it was build for meetings and confrences optimized for high quality 'streaming'. So the problem of high data consumption arrises with these apps.

Taking a recent survey about online education about 49% of students in the student population dont't have access to a good quality network connection. This is a major problem in the education sector going completely 'online' 

## The Solution

The Online-classess are mostly presentation oriented , so how can we reduce the data consumption without affecting the quality of online clasees ?

We at Unicorn Dev community we focused to find a solution to this problem and hence we've come up with ![logo](https://github.com/hackerflow-io/UnicornDev-s/blob/main/public/images/logo.svg)
A platform that is focused in improving the quality of online education and reducing data consumption.

## Prototype

Here we introduce a board where you can draw freely (and essentially take classes, also can be used in other industries). This protype enables us to show that our idea is completely possible with the present available tech.

## How we do it

We cut out the unnecessary data consumption and transfer only the essential information. In UnicornTeach we work with a simple principle in changing only the pixel where any change has occurred based on a coordinate system. Here the only data consumed is for the transfer the position of the pixel with respect to the coordinate system.
