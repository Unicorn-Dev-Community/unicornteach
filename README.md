### The Problem?

<div align="center">

![High Data Consumption](https://github.com/TheAmalShibu/unicornteachV2/blob/main/Assets/highdata.png)

</div>

Theses platforms as a whole was not build and optimized for online education, it was build for meetings and confrences optimized for high quality 'streaming'. So the problem of high data consumption arrises with these apps.

Taking a recent survey about online education about 49% of students in the student population dont't have access to a good quality network connection. This is a major problem in the education sector going completely 'online' 

## The Solution ?

We cut out the unnecessary data consumption and transfer only the essential information. Here we introduce a board where you can draw freely (and essentially take classes, also can be used in other industries). In UnicornTeach we work with a simple principle in changing only the pixel where any change has occurred based on a coordinate system. Here the only data consumed is for the transfer the position of the pixel with respect to the coordinate system.
